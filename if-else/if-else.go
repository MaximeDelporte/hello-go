	Summary:
	The existing program is used to restrict access to a resource based on day of the week and user role. Currently, the program allows any yser to access the resource. Implement the functionnality needed to grant resource access using any combination of Ã¬f`, `else if` and `else`.

	Requirements:
	* Use the accessGranted() and accessDenied() functions to display informational messages.
	* Access at any time: Admin, Manager
	* Access weekends: Contractor
	* Access weekdays: Member
	* Access Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: Guest
